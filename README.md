Only deploy this with CodeSandbox and/or Render.

The official link ***is*** going to be slow

# What is Greatsword?

# Important
In order to use "unsafe" Greatsword V3 links you must put your pointer in the middle of the "deceptive site" screen, and type "thisisunsafe". This may redirect you to a new tab, or something else. You may have to go back to the same site and repeat this process up to 10 times. Eventually it will become usable.

# Current bugs:
* Chrome safe browsing may falsely flag links.
* If this happens, about:blank cloak reports as "unsafe" and typing "thisisunsafe" does not work.

New links ***are*** added to the discord every day.
